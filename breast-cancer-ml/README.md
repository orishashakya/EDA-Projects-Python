# Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Framingham dataset from Kaggle. It demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling using Python libraries. The project highlights how raw healthcare data can be transformed into actionable insights using logistic regression.

# Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Framingham Dataset
+ Features include patient information, health metrics, and diagnostic indicators relevant to cancer classification.
+ Target: Malignant vs. Benign tumor.

# Tools & Technologies
+ Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
+ Model: Binary Logistic Regression

# Key Steps
+ Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Feature selection and scaling

+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized feature distributions, correlations, and class balance
Identified patterns between features and target variable

+ Modeling:
Built a logistic regression classifier
Split data into training and testing sets
Evaluated model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

# Results:
+ Achieved 96.4% accuracy in classifying malignant and benign tumors
+ Visualizations helped understand important features impacting predictions

# Project Highlights
+ Demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow from data cleaning to model evaluation
+ Uses real-world dataset for practical healthcare prediction
+ Showcases proficiency in data manipulation, visualization, and logistic regression
